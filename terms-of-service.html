        <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-8 font-montserrat">Terms of Service</h1>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
            <p>By booking a service with Lawn Surgeon, you agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#C8AA6E] font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Service & Access</h2>
            <p>We require clear access to your garden on the scheduled service day. If gates are locked or access is blocked, a call-out fee may apply. We operate in most weather conditions but reserve the right to reschedule in extreme weather to protect your lawn and our equipment.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#C8AA6E] font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Pet Waste</h2>
            <p>Ideally, the lawn should be free of pet waste prior to our arrival. If waste is present and you have not accepted the optional Pet Waste Removal service, we reserve the right to refuse to complete the project. In such cases, the full visit fee may still be charged.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#C8AA6E] font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Payments & Deposits</h2>
            <p>A non-refundable deposit (typically £15) is required to secure your booking slot. This is deducted from your first invoice. Regular maintenance plans are billed via Direct Debit or secure payment link upon completion.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#C8AA6E] font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Cancellations</h2>
            <p>We require at least 24 hours' notice for cancellations. Cancellations made with less than 24 hours' notice may incur a late cancellation fee.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl text-[#C8AA6E] font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Community Priority Tiers</h2>
            <p>Discounts associated with Community Priority Tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold) are contingent on the number of active households on your street. If the number of active households drops below the threshold for your tier, your discount level may be adjusted accordingly. We will notify you of any such changes.</p>
